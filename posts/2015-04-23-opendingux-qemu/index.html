Hardware-wise it is completely different from jz47xx SoCs with different memory map and additional hardware. This means that only Malta kernel could be used in qemu and not Dingoo a320 or GCW Zero one. Of course, this kernel's settings could be tweaked according to the situation.</p><p>At the same time no one forbids to use any rootfs with Malta kernel and Dingoo a320's rootfs could be used as well, of course with minor tweaking for qemu's specifics. This allows to run any software compiled for Dingoo a320 OpenDingux as-is without recompilation. There are restrictions though: software must be generic and must use common linux kernel interfaces and devices. So, programs using MXU simd extension or non-standard devices won't work and probably crash.</p><p>The following text could be interesting for developers who would like to test the behavior of their applications in OpenDingux or debug them in a more comfortable way than with real devices.</p><p>From the point of view of the text above, this is not even an OpenDingux emulation but rather a fair OpenDingux port for Malta board being run inside qemu.</p><p><em>Note: When 'rootfs' is mentioned here, it's about Dingoo a320 OpenDingux rootfs (cpu: mips32 r1 soft-float) if the contrary is not explicitly stated.</em></p><h2 id="building-up-a-modified-malta-kernel">Building up a modified Malta kernel</h2><p>First a kernel should be prepared which is a slightly modified Malta kernel. The following implies that you have mipsel toolchain located at /opt otherwise download from <a href="http://www.treewalker.org/opendingux/opendingux-toolchain.2012-06-16.tar.bz2" target="_blank">here</a> and unpack to /opt.</p><pre><code>> git clone -b jz-3.16-qemu  https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/linux.git
> cd linux
> export ARCH=mips
> export CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/opendingux-toolchain/usr/bin/mipsel-linux-
> make gcw0-qemu_defconfig
> make
</code></pre><p>Despite the name 'gcw-qemu_defconfig' it has little to do with GCW Zero hardware. In fact it's a greatly reduced 'malta_defconfig' with some elements needed for OpenDingux:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/linux-gcw0/commit/0a2b8cb9e20354821c4830b1116d0dfb87afa8e1" target="_blank">Patch</a> which allows i8042 serial controller to properly enable on emulated Malta board. This makes AT standard keyboard work in qemu. For some reason this is missing from mainline kernel, see related <a href="http://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/6419/" target="_blank">discussion</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/linux-gcw0/commit/b3570be20f77fad5da056c68ed9379fb59997e40" target="_blank">Patch</a> that makes cirrusfb driver behave closer to Dingoo a320 driver. Double buffering and vsync are not supported but applications that rely on them will run just fine. If an application requests a resolution that is different from 320x240, cirrusfb just sets requested resolution as-is without rescaling.</li><li>Using initramfs with device tree in tree.txt and <a href="https://github.com/pcercuei/mininit" target="_blank">mininit</a>.</li><li>Unused hardware is eliminated from defconfig, some other drivers are built statically.</li><li>Kernel command line is hardcoded to: <code>CONFIG_CMDLINE="boot=/dev/sda loop0=/boot/rootfs.squashfs root=/dev/loop0 video=cirrusfb:320x240-16@60</code></li></ul><p>After compilation is complete the kernel image is located at current directory: ./vmlinux This kernel can run both modified Dingoo a320's rootfs and GCW Zero's rootfs.</p><h2 id="building-up-opendingux-rootfs-with-buildroot">Building up OpenDingux rootfs with buildroot</h2><p>Second a rootfs image is needed, and buildroot system is used for creating it. In this case a slightly modified OpenDingux rootfs for Dingoo a320 is used. This means that it can also be used with Dingoo a380, Ritmix RZX50 and qemu, and all binaries compiled for Dingoo a320 OpenDingux could be runned as-is.</p><pre><code>> git clone -b opendingux-2012.11 https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/opendingux-buildroot.git
> cd opendingux-buildroot
> make a380_defconfig
> make
</code></pre><p>After some hours of work if no error, the file we need will be located at output/images/rootfs.squashfs</p><h2 id="preparing-a-disk-image">Preparing a disk image</h2><p>Historically Dingux and OpenDingux ran on external sd-card of Dingoo a320 allowing a dualboot between native OS and Dingux/OpenDingux. For simplification kernel and rootfs images were placed on FAT partition of the sd-card and additional software went to 'local' directory, thus typical dir structure looked like: local/bin, local/etc, local/home, local/sbin.</p><p>When booting Dingux/OpenDingux sd-card partition was mounted as /boot, then rootfs was mounted on / (and rootfs had an additional symlink /usr/local => /boot/local).</p><p>To emulate this behavior a disk image with similar layout must be created.</p><pre><code>> dd if=/dev/zero of=512M bs=1M count=512
> mkdosfs 512M
> sudo mount 512M /mnt/
> sudo cp rootfs.squashfs /mnt/
> sudo mkdir /mnt/local /mnt/local/apps /mnt/local/home /mnt/local/etc
> # copy some more software to /mnt/local/apps and unmount
> sudo umount /mnt/
</code></pre><p>Note that kernel is compiled with the following built-in command line:</p><pre><code>CONFIG_CMDLINE="boot=/dev/sda loop0=/boot/rootfs.squashfs root=/dev/loop0 video=cirrusfb:320x240-16@60"
</code></pre><h2 id="running-qemu-on-linux-host">Running qemu on Linux host</h2><p>Qemu should be already installed on your system otherwise do</p><pre><code>> sudo apt-get install qemu
</code></pre><p>At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.2.0 but no harm if an older one is used (at least 1.3.0 worked fine). Now it's time to burst into action. Typical script to run qemu would look like:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

MACHINE="-M malta -m 256"
FIRMWARE="-kernel vmlinux -hda 512M"
HARDWARE="-sdl -soundhw ac97 -k en-us -rtc clock=vm"
NETWORK="-net nic,model=e1000 -net user"
SERIAL="-serial stdio -monitor none"

qemu-system-mipsel $MACHINE $FIRMWARE $HARDWARE $NETWORK $SERIAL

</code></pre><p>The explanation is obvious: <code>-M malta -m 256</code> for Malta board with 256 megabytes of RAM. <code>-kernel vmlinux -hda 512M</code> for the generated kernel and disk image, <code>-serial stdio</code> for redirecting serial output to console, other settings for enabling sound, keyboard and network card. If no error, the kernel booting log will immediately appear which ends with login prompt. Type 'root' to log in.</p><pre><code>opendingux:/boot/local/home #

Latest Qemu 2.2.0 binary could be downloaded <a href="http://lassauge.free.fr/qemu/release/Qemu-2.2.0-windows.zip" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>Here's the example of run.bat:</p><pre><code>@CLS
set PORTFWD=hostfwd=tcp::21-:21,hostfwd=tcp::22-:22,hostfwd=tcp::23-:23

set MACHINE=-M malta -m 256
set FIRMWARE=-kernel vmlinux -hda 512M
set HARDWARE=-sdl -soundhw ac97 -k en-us -rtc clock=vm
set NETWORK=-net nic,model=e1000 -net user,%PORTFWD%
set SERIAL=-serial telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait

set SETTINGS=%MACHINE% %FIRMWARE% %HARDWARE% %NETWORK% %SERIAL%

qemu-system-mipselw -L BIOS %SETTINGS%
</code></pre><p>Note that the combination of <code>-sdl -k en-us</code> is very important. If you omit one part you'll happen to have non-working arrow keys. <code>-sdl</code> option instructs to use SDL for video and input (default is GTK) and <code>-k en-us</code> forces US key layout.</p><p>The other annoying thing is Windows console (cmd.exe) which doesn't work right with escape sequences. Moreover, SDL.dll completely hijacks the stdio output and redirects it to a file stdio.txt, so using -serial stdio is impossible.</p><p>That's why a special redirection is used: <code>-serial telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait</code> which means that serial will be fed to localhost on port 5555 using qemu as server and qemu will not wait for connection.</p><p>This trick works on Linux hosts as well and using <code>telnet localhost 5555</code> is possible to access to serial output but it's fairly overcomplicating since usual stdio is just fine.</p><p><img src="/files/2015-04-23-opendingux-qemu/qemu-win1.png" alt="Qemu runs on Windows and scales up gmenu2x"></p><p><img src="/files/2015-04-23-opendingux-qemu/qemu-win2.png" alt="System Info shows MIPS Malta processor"></p><h2 id="setting-up-putty-to-catch-serial-output-from-qemu">Setting up Putty to catch serial output from qemu</h2><p>To catch the redirected serial one would use a simple Putty application, download is <a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>First run qemu, then putty. Set Host Name to localhost, Port to 5555, Connection type to telnet and Saved Sessions to 'telnet' or any other name. Press Save and you are done. Optionally, Window -> Translation -> Remote character set could be set to UTF-8. Double click on the 'telnet' and press any key on black screen.
