                <h1>The Last Mission Remake</h1>
                <p>
                    Originally this game was released in 1987 by Spanish company Opera Soft for multiple 8-bit computers
                    including MSX1, MSX2, ZX-Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and even x86 PC.
                    As most games of that era, The Last Mission is a screen-to-screen labyrinth game with shooter elements
                </p>
                <p>
                    You control a flying robot with laser which have to guide the caterpillar platform through the levels
                    of the undeground labyrinth up to the planet's surface. The robot can fly only a limited amount of time
                    and have to land on the platform to restore the energy. The platform in turn cannot fly and shoot and
                    can move on the floor only, so the robot should shoot out enemies and clear the passage ahead in order
                    to move it further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This remake was based on the x86 PC version with 4-color CGA graphics and beeper sound. All graphics
                    was colorized to 256-color palette by hand using MSX2 version as an example. Later Alexey Pavlov ported
                    this game to iOS devices and did some gameplay and graphical enhancements as well. He also added sound
                    effects and free music by Mark Braga.<br>
                    Most probably, iOS version is nowhere to be found now, sorry for that.

                        - The 'master' branch contains version 0.8 and 'unstable' has an unfinished level editor with lots of code
                        improvements, though totally identical gameplay-wise.<br>
