                    The Last Mission is a side-view arcade game without scrolling (viewpoint moves from screen to screen)
                    with map of big dimensions. The game takes its inspiration from games such as Underwurlde and Starquake.

                    You control a tank-like robot which can be divided in two: you rotate caterpillar and head-cannon, and
                    the head part can fly off on its own. However, the head can only survive separately for a short amount
                    of time, and your restart position is dictated by the location of the body, even if the head has moved
                    forward through further screens. Therefore, the difficulty of the game was in making it possible to advance
                    with the assembled robot's two parts.
